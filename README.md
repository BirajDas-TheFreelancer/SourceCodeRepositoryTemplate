			Microservice Archtecture
			
				Intro -> Microservices are a modern approach to software whereby application/feature/functionality code is delivered in small, manageable pieces, independent of others.
				
				Benifit -> Their small scale and relative isolation can lead to many additional benefits, such as easier maintenance, improved productivity, greater fault tolerance, better business alignment, and more.
				
				Highlights : 
					1. Have their own technology stack, inclusive of the database and data management model.
					2. Communicate with one another over a combination of REST APIs, event streaming, and message brokers and are organized by business capability, with the line separating services often referred to as a bounded context
					3. Code can be updated more easily - new features or functionality can be added without touching the entire application
					4. Teams can use different stacks and different programming languages for different components.
					5. Components can be scaled independently of one another, reducing the waste and cost associated with having to scale entire applications because a single feature might be facing too much load.
